# service-authentication
This module is coupled to the application in order to be easier and faster to make it work. But it intends to represent a separate micro-service that is responsible for the authentication of users.

For the current purpose, this service only generates and returns a JWT when a valid username and password combination is provided. Users are mocked in a list.
